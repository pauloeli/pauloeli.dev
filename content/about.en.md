Hello, my name is Paulo Henrique Eli. **I have a Masterâ€™s degree in Information and Communication Technologies from the
Federal University of Santa Catarina (UFSC) and work as a Software Architect**.

I have been working in the **software development field since 2007**, starting with Intersystems Cache, Javascript, and
Delphi technologies. Over the past 7 years, I have focused on software architecture, Java - Spring, Micronaut, and Java
EE - and DevOps.

In an **academic context**, I have a strong interest in teaching programming logic and programming, with a focus on
developing tools and platforms that facilitate the study of this discipline. By the way, if you're interested, you can
read my dissertation on teaching methodologies for software
development [at this address](https://repositorio.ufsc.br/handle/123456789/185430). It will provide a better
understanding of the research I conducted for a year with over 200 students, exploring their profiles and how to develop
effective exercises and materials.

On a daily basis, I work with the following languages and technologies:

* Java (Spring, EE, Micronaut, Reactor)
* AWS (RDS, SNS, SQS, CloudWatch, S3, Lambda, EKS,...)
* TypeScript
* NodeJS
* ElasticSearch
* MongoDB (Atlas)
* PostgreSQL
* Kubernetes
* Docker
* Angular
* Grafana
* Kibana
* Git
