# S3 Avro Repair

[NodeJs application](https://github.com/pauloeli/s3-avro-repair) to connect and download avro from S3 bucket, test and
repair. You can configure to upload de recoverd file, if you want. This application has been builded to solve a specific
problem, so improvements can be done.

I wish this project can be used to "start" from other people needs. In no way can I be held responsible for any loss of
data or problems that the application may cause **(use at your own risk)**

### Avro Tools

Documentation about the tool and details can be
seen [here](https://www.michael-noll.com/blog/2013/03/17/reading-and-writing-avro-files-from-the-command-line/).

More about `cat` command you can read in [this](https://www.mail-archive.com/dev@avro.apache.org/msg07299.html) feature
documentation.

### Settings

It's necessary set the path of Java will be used to run Avro Tools. To configure edit
the [application.yml](resources/application.yml).
If you don't know where is the Java, you can use the `whereis` linux command to show.

### Install

```bash
npm install --no-optional 
```

### Parameters

The parameters must be set via process variables for NodeJS. Here are the available settings:
